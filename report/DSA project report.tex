\section{Introduction}

\section{Main problem}

In this project, we were supposed to build a web server that is made fault-tolerant using omnipaxos.
The web server should be accessed via REST or gRPC and store some data that is
accessed in a consistent manner. Furthermore, each node should maintain some statistics on
the number of requests they have handled, and we should make the node with the most requests
take over leadership when it passes a certain threshold.
